these are fake viruses, somewhat. they're classified as 'trojan' to me, as they're named something else, other than 'virus.bat'
they are made in BAT, and very simple and easy to edit. 
to stop the 'virus,' just log out or shutdown.
they're for windows.
you'll need to set up the shortcuts, which you'd probably know how to do, considering you're attempting troll trojan viruses to troll friends or family.
enjoy, edit as needed, add as needed.
